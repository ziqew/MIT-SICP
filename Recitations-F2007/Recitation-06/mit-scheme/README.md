Recitation 6
============ 

Contains worked solutions expressed in the MIT Scheme dialect.

Core code that is used throughout these examples:

<pre>
(define (make-units C L H)
 (list C L H))
(define get-units-C car)
(define get-units-L cadr)
(define get-units-H caddr)

(define (make-class number units)
 (list number units))
(define get-class-number car)
(define get-class-units cadr)

(define (get-class-total-units class)
 (let ((units (get-class-units class)))
  (+ 
   (get-units-C units)
   (get-units-L units)
   (get-units-H units))))

(define (same-class? c1 c2)
 (= (get-class-number c1) (get-class-number c2)))
</pre>
